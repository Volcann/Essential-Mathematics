# Data Analysis and Statistics Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to provide a comprehensive overview of key concepts in statistics and data analysis. Each notebook includes theoretical explanations, practical code examples, and visualizations to facilitate understanding and application.

## Contents

### 1. Descriptive Statistics
The **Descriptive Statistics** notebook covers the fundamental statistical moments and measures used to summarize and describe datasets. Topics include:
- **Statistics Moments**: Calculation of mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.
- **Measures of Central Tendency**: Overview of mean, median, and mode.
- **Measures of Dispersion**: Understanding range, variance, and standard deviation.
- **Percentiles and Quantiles**: Calculation and interpretation of percentile and quantile values.
- **Five-Number Summary**: Presentation of minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.

### 2. Data Distributions
The **Data Distributions** notebook explains various data distributions and visualizes their characteristics. Topics include:
- **Discrete and Continuous Distributions**: Understanding and comparing different types of probability distributions (e.g., binomial, normal).
- **Visualizations**: Use of Matplotlib and Seaborn to create histograms, density plots, and other visual representations of distributions.

### 3. Inferential Statistics
The **Inferential Statistics** notebook introduces key concepts in making inferences about populations based on sample data. Topics include:
- **Confidence Intervals**: Calculation and interpretation of confidence intervals for population parameters.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Explanation of null and alternative hypotheses, along with practical examples of t-tests and ANOVA.
- **Comparing Means**: Independent samples t-tests and ANOVA for comparing group means.

### 4. Probability
The **Probability** notebook provides an overview of probability theory, including:
- **Basic Probability Concepts**: Definitions of sample space, events, and probability calculations.
- **Complementary Probability**: Understanding complementary events and the law of total probability.
- **Conditional Probability**: Calculation and interpretation of conditional probabilities.
- **Independent Events**: Explanation of independent events and their implications.
- **Probability Distributions**: Visualization of discrete (binomial) and continuous (normal) distributions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the notebooks, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scipy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib-venn` (for Venn diagrams)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy pandas matplotlib-venn
