For example, rolling a fair six-sided die gives a sample space of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n   - **Event**: A specific outcome or a set of outcomes from the sample space (e.g., rolling a number less than or equal to 3).\n\n2. **Calculating Probability**:\n   - The probability of an event is calculated as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes in the sample space:  \n     \\[\n     P(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Complementary Probability**:\n   - The complement of an event A, denoted as A', is the event that A does not occur. The sum of the probabilities of an event and its complement is always 1:  \n     \\[\n     P(A) + P(A') = 1\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conditional Probability**:\n   - The probability of event A given that event B has occurred is called conditional probability:  \n     \\[\n     P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Independent Events**:\n   - Two events A and B are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other:  \n     \\[\n     P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B)\n     \\]\n\n6. **Law of Total Probability**:\n   - For any two events A and B, the law states:  \n     \\[\n     P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\n     \\]\n\n7. **Probability Distribution Functions**:\n   - **Discrete Probability Distribution**: For example, the binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of trials.\n   - **Continuous Probability Distribution**: For example, the normal distribution is defined by its mean and standard deviation and is characterized by its bell-shaped curve.\n\n### Usage Instructions:\n1. **Run the code** to see various probability calculations and visualizations.\n2. Modify the parameters (e.g., number of trials, probabilities) to explore different probability scenarios.\n3.
